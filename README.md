# Period Pal
Period Pal (formerly known as Exclamation Point) connects those in need for menstrual hygiene products (for those experiencing period poverty or are caught off guard) to others who are willing to share.


## Inspiration
We were inspired by the many nonprofits that focus on period poverty as well as our own experiences a women who menstruate and the times we were caught off guard by our periods.

## What it does
Period Pal connects those in need for menstrual hygiene products (for those experiencing period poverty or are caught off guard).

## How we built it
Our website is hosted using Google Cloud's App Engine. We used Radar.io to detect the user's location to help find nearby period pals. The Bandwidth API was used to send text messages to these nearby period pals to request for help.
